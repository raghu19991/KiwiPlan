#Trouble Shooting  
1)Check that python directory path exists in the PATH env variable.If not pls add it to the PATH variable.
2)If the file is giving error pls run the file in command prompt by providing path of python
"<path_to_pythonDir>/python.exe AngleBwClockHands.py  
eg:  
"c:/python37/python.exe" AngleBwClockHands.py  
3)File extension association should be <Python_Ins_Dir>/Python.exe (This would have been done automatically if python was installed using setup wizard or msi).  
If not,please associate using open with or changing file type using extensions for .py files.
